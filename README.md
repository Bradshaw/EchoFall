Design
------

The goal is to implement various experimental concepts in a simple
non-intrusive way, some of these concepts are:

+	Procedurally generated world
+	A single-player experience but with multiplayer elements
+	Non-verbal communication
+	Non-violent content


Technology
----------

The first implementation will be in LÃ¶ve2d, to test the ideas in a familiar
environment.


Ideas
-----

+	Players have their own personal world, and they can use a portal to 
	visit others
+	In other worlds, collecting items and bringing them to the portal allows
	the creation of a permanent link between worlds
+	In own world, collected items can be placed and challenges can be created
