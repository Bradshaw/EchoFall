Design
------

The goal is to implement various experimental concepts in a simple non-intrusive
way, some of these concepts are:

>	Procedurally generated world
>	A single-player experience but with multiplayer elements
>	Non-verbal communication
>	Non-violent content


Technology
----------

The first implementation will be in LÃ¶ve2d, to test the ideas in a familiar
environment.

Porting to Javascript and Node.js is planned in the near future.
